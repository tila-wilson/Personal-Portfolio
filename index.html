            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Hi, I'm Tila.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                I grew up in a small town of 1400 people with a graduating class of only 35. My personality was way too big for a small town! I have always had a good idea of what I wanted life to look like, and I have never been afraid to fail and try again, progressing to the next step in my journey. I took college courses for graphic design but quickly landed a great job in the workforce and never completed the degree. Although I had dreams of moving to a big city, Springfield, MO quickly became home. The cost of living and general development progression was and is very attractive, at least in this phase of life.

                My work history started in the travel industry as a travel agent for a large firm. I did that for about seven years and then moved to my current job as an executive assistant for a software company. I have been in my current role for about four years now. In the last four years my skill set has grown exponentially. Working in the tech industry has piqued my interest in learning to code. I have ventured back to the classroom to pursue a certificate in web development. I plan to complete this certification in December of 2021.

                I enjoy investing in real estate, and I remodel houses as a hobby. I have always considered myself a creative person and real estate was a way that I could be creative and also improve my neighborhood.

                Iâ€™m part of a large family, consisting of five siblings, one of which is my identical twin. Although we are identical, as life has progressed most would say we are quite opposite of one another. My family is close, and we value spending quality time together. Specifically, we spend time together investing in and remodeling houses. I couldn't do it without the help of my family and the unique talents they contribute. Remodeling houses is a family affair that allows us to create many fun and memorable moments.

                I am a huge advocate for mental health and the benefits of therapy. After participating in therapy for many years, I have developed an interest in behavioral health. This passion led to my interest in coding, because everything we know is a concept that has been created for us by parents and caregivers, as well as less obviously by the pressures of society. So with the same concepts as coding this page, I can program new concepts to live life in the most fulfilling way. Coding is a physical representation of what I am capable of mentally. I know there is a stigma associated with going to therapy, but as Brene Brown would say, "strength is in vulnerability". Therapy has changed my life and opened doors for me personally and professionally.

                Being an active member of my community is a huge priority of mine. I like to volunteer for several nonprofits as time allows as a way to give back to others. Ultimately, I strive to be the change I want to see in the world.
